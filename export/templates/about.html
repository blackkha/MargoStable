                    <h4>What is the Leverage Indicator?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Leverage Indicator is a metric we've developed to identify cryptocurrencies with high trading activity 
                        relative to their market capitalization. While not a direct measure of leverage, it serves as a proxy for identifying 
                        assets that may be experiencing significant leverage trading.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>How is it Calculated?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our Leverage Indicator is calculated using the following formula:
                        <pre class="bg-dark text-light p-3 rounded">Leverage Indicator = (Volume / Market Cap) × (1 + |24h Price Change %| / 100) × 100</pre>
                        
                        This formula considers:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Volume to Market Cap Ratio:</strong> A higher ratio suggests more trading activity relative to the asset's size</li>
                            <li><strong>Price Volatility:</strong> We factor in 24-hour price changes as volatile assets often attract leverage traders</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Data Sources</h4>
