                        <p>
                            The <strong>Borrow/Repay Ratio</strong> is a metric that compares the amount of a cryptocurrency that has been borrowed 
                            against the amount that has been repaid within a specific time period (usually 24 hours). This ratio 
                            provides valuable insights into market sentiment and trading behavior.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Formula:</strong> Borrow/Repay Ratio = Total Borrowed Amount / Total Repaid Amount

                        <h3>Why is this ratio important?</h3>
                        <p>
                            In margin trading and lending markets, borrowing activity often correlates with traders opening leveraged 
                            positions. By tracking which cryptocurrencies have high borrow demand relative to repayments, we can 
                            identify assets that traders are actively using for leveraged positions.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ratio > 2.0:</strong> High borrowing demand, potentially indicating strong bullish or bearish sentiment</li>
                            <li><strong>Ratio 1.0-2.0:</strong> Moderate borrowing activity</li>
                            <li><strong>Ratio < 1.0:</strong> More repayments than new borrowing, possibly indicating position closing</li>
                        </ul>
